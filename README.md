## TimeSeriesForecasting_MSFT_data

Problem Statement: Build a time series forecasting model to predict future values based on historical data. This could be applied to stock prices, weather data, or sales data.

I have used Microsoft stocks dataset, available on Kaggle. I have implemented a LSTM model, which is a Recurent Neural Network (RNN). Also, attached is a report explaining some concepts in the code. All essential details will be present in the report. Rest can be understood through the comments in the python notebook file.
